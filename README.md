# Code Refactor

In this project, my job was to refactor the HTML and CSS files of an existing website to bring it up to accessibility standards.

For the most part, this entailed replacing generic <div> tags with descriptive semantic tags, as well as adding alt attributes to images. All this was done while preserving the content and layout of the website.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
