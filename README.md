# Code Refactor

In this project, my job was to refactor the HTML and CSS files of an existing website to bring it up to accessibility standards.

For the most part, this entailed replacing generic &lt;div&gt; tags with descriptive semantic tags, as well as adding alt attributes to images to the index.html file. Adjustments then had to be made in the style.css file. Redundant lines of code in style.css were consolidated down to just the essentials. All this was done while preserving the content and layout of the website.

## User Story
